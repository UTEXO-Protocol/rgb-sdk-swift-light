# Testing BTC and RGB payments with the example app

This runbook drives the [example app](README.md) on an iOS Simulator to test,
end to end:

- a BTC send between two wallets;
- an RGB receive from an issuer wallet, on a witness invoice;
- an RGB send between two wallets, signed on the device by the SDK.

It covers two environments. The **local regtest stack** is self-contained,
needs no funds or credentials, and lets you mine blocks and read gateway
internals, so use it for repeatable runs and for debugging. A **deployed signet
gateway** tests the real deployment, but needs an operator token and funds on
that chain.

The steps match the Kotlin SDK's runbook, so a run on one platform can be
compared line by line with the other.

## What you need

- macOS with Xcode 27.0 and a booted iPhone simulator, with the app installed:
  `xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16" && example-app/scripts/install.sh`.
- Python 3, for [`drive.py`](scripts/drive.py), and Node 20+, for
  [`issuer.mjs`](scripts/issuer.mjs).
- For the local stack only, a checkout of the lightsdk-gateway repository,
  built with `pnpm install && pnpm build`. It holds the gateway and its regtest
  stack (`regtest/`), which runs in Docker with the compose plugin. The stack builds rgb-node-api from source on its first
  start, and some of rgb-node-api's git dependencies are private, so your
  ssh-agent needs a key with read access to the UTEXO-Protocol repositories.
- A Mac clock within 300 seconds of real time. The simulator uses the Mac's
  clock, and invoice creation checks the gateway's expiry against it.

Run the commands below from the repository root. Keep tokens and mnemonics in a
working directory outside the repository:

```sh
W=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/utexo-payment-test; mkdir -p "$W"
export LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO=<path to the lightsdk-gateway checkout>
```

`gateway.sh` and `issuer.mjs` read `LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO` too. Without it they
look for the checkout next to this repository, under the repository's GitHub
name.

## The helpers

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) | Builds the app for the simulator and installs it on the booted one. |
| [`drive.py`](scripts/drive.py) | Relaunches the app with its fields in the environment, which connects and runs the named actions in order, then prints what the app logged. |
| [`issuer.mjs`](scripts/issuer.mjs) | Drives an RGB issuer and sender — a wallet on rgb-node-api whose keys the script holds and signs with (`setup`, `send-rgb`, `refresh`, and `address`, `create-utxos`, `issue` on other chains), and regtest (`mine`, `fund`). |
| [`gateway.sh`](scripts/gateway.sh) | Starts a local lightsdk-gateway against the regtest stack. |

Each `drive.py` run is one app session. `--wallet` names the wallet, and the app
keeps one Keychain seed per wallet ID and network. A wallet ID is bound to the
first gateway user it registers with, and reusing it with another user fails
with `wallet.invalid_state`. So use fresh wallet IDs whenever you create new
gateway users, as the `RUN` variable below does.

## Local regtest run

### 1. Start the regtest stack

```sh
"$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/regtest.sh start
```

This starts bitcoind, electrs, esplora (`:3002`), the RGB proxy and rgb-node-api
(`:34000`) on a fresh chain, deleting any earlier regtest state. The first start
builds the rgb-node-api image, which takes several minutes.

Only esplora and rgb-node-api are published on the host. If `3002` or `34000` is
taken, for example by another regtest stack, start with `REGTEST_ESPLORA_PORT` /
`REGTEST_RGB_NODE_API_PORT` set, and pass the same ports to the gateway
(`ESPLORA_URL`, `RGB_NODE_API_URL`) and to `drive` (`--tip-url`). rgb-node-api
reaches bitcoind, electrs and the proxy over the compose network, which is why
invoices name the proxy `rpc://proxy:3000/json-rpc`.

### 2. Set up the issuer and issue an asset

```sh
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs setup
# issuer 1a2b3c4d
# asset rgb:…         <- keep this as ASSET
```

`setup` creates a throwaway issuer wallet on rgb-node-api (its mnemonic is kept in
`$TMPDIR/utexo-payment-test/issuer.json`), funds it with 1 BTC, creates colored
UTXOs and issues 1,000 units of an NIA asset (`--ticker`, `--name` and
`--supply` change it). Put the printed asset ID in `ASSET`.

### 3. Start the gateway and create two users

```sh
example-app/scripts/gateway.sh > "$W/gateway.log" 2>&1 &
until curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8490/v1/health > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done
for u in a b; do
    curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8490/v1/users \
        -H "x-operator-token: $(cat "$W/gateway/operator_token")" > "$W/user-$u.json"
done
RUN=$(date +%s)
drive() {
    who=$1; shift
    example-app/scripts/drive.py --gateway http://127.0.0.1:8490 --network regtest \
        --tip-url http://127.0.0.1:3002/blocks/tip/height \
        --token-file "$W/user-$who.json" --wallet "loc-$RUN-$who" \
        --mnemonic-out "$W/mnemonic-$who" "$@"
}
```

The simulator shares the Mac's network, so the app reaches the gateway and
esplora on `127.0.0.1` directly. The trusted chain tip comes from the local
esplora, not from the gateway.

### 4. BTC payment

```sh
drive a address                    # address: bcrt1p…   <- A
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs fund <A> 0.01
drive a sync,balance               # vanilla settled=1000000
drive b address                    # address: bcrt1p…   <- B
drive a sendbtc recipient=<B> amount=50000
                                   # sent: txid …
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b sync,balance               # vanilla settled=50000
```

The device validates the gateway-prepared transaction against the request and
the trusted tip, signs it, and the gateway broadcasts it.

### 5. RGB receive: issuer → A, witness invoice

```sh
drive a witnessinvoice             # invoice: rgb:~/~/~/bcrt:wvout:…   <- A_INVOICE
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs send-rgb "$ASSET" 500 '<A_INVOICE>'
drive a sync,transfers,assets      # ReceiveWitness WaitingBroadcast; future=500
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs refresh   # the issuer sees A's ACK and broadcasts
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive a sync,assets                # settled=500 spendable=500
```

Quote invoices: they contain `?` and `&`. For a witness invoice, `send-rgb` adds
1,000 sats for the output it creates for the receiver.

Every RGB payment takes three turns, because the sender (the issuer and the SDK
alike, with `donation: false`) broadcasts only after the receiver ACKs:

1. The receiver syncs: it fetches the consignment, validates it and ACKs. Its
   transfer then reads `WaitingBroadcast`.
2. The sender refreshes: it sees the ACK and broadcasts.
3. After a block, the receiver's next sync settles the transfer.

The txid that `send-rgb` and `rgbsend` print is not on chain until step 2.

rgb-node-api also refreshes every wallet it has loaded every 10 seconds on its
own, so steps 2 and 3 can happen between your commands. The app's invoices ask
for zero confirmations, so a transfer may already read `Settled` where the
comments show `WaitingBroadcast`, and a sender may broadcast before you sync it.

### 6. RGB send: A → B, signed by the SDK

```sh
drive a utxos                      # created 4 colored UTXO(s) in …
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b witnessinvoice             # invoice: rgb:~/~/~/bcrt:wvout:…   <- B_INVOICE
drive a rgbsend recipient='<B_INVOICE>' amount=100 assetId="$ASSET"
                                   # sent: txid … batchTransferIdx=…
drive b sync,transfers             # ReceiveWitness WaitingBroadcast, amounts=100
drive a sync,transfers             # Send WaitingConfirmations, amounts=400 (A's change),
                                   # listed after step 5's settled receive
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b sync,assets                # settled=100
drive a sync,assets                # settled=400
```

An RGB send is funded from colored UTXOs only: its fee, B's 1,000-sat witness
output and A's change all come from them, not from A's vanilla balance. The
1,000-sat output A received the asset on is not enough, hence `utxos` first. It
tops A up to five UTXOs with free allocation slots, and the output A received
on still has free slots, so it creates four. Sync B before A: B's sync ACKs,
and A's sync is what broadcasts.

### 7. Stop

```sh
kill %1                            # the gateway started above
"$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/regtest.sh stop
```

## Deployed signet run

The app's defaults already target UTEXO's signet environment. The gateway is
`https://minimal-gateway.utexo.com`, the network is `Network.signet`, and the
trusted tip comes from `https://esplora-api.utexo.com/blocks/tip/height`. UTEXO's
signet is its own chain, not Bitcoin's public signet, even though its invoices
use the `sb` tag. Look its transactions up at
`https://esplora-api.utexo.com/tx/<txid>`; mempool.space does not know them.

Create the users with the deployment's operator token. Then use the same `drive`
helper without the local flags:

```sh
for u in a b; do
    curl -s -X POST https://minimal-gateway.utexo.com/v1/users \
        -H "x-operator-token: $GATEWAY_OPERATOR_TOKEN" > "$W/signet-user-$u.json"
done
RUN=$(date +%s)
drive() {
    who=$1; shift
    example-app/scripts/drive.py --token-file "$W/signet-user-$who.json" \
        --wallet "gw-$RUN-$who" --mnemonic-out "$W/signet-mnemonic-$who" "$@"
}
```

Steps 4–6 work the same way, except:

- nothing mines blocks, so wait for a confirmation where the local run mines one;
- A must be funded by someone holding BTC and an asset on UTEXO's signet: BTC to
  `drive a address`, and the asset to `drive a witnessinvoice`, sent with
  `witness_data` for the receiving output;
- invoices end in `endpoints=rpcs://rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc`;
- UTEXO's proxy ACKs a consignment as soon as the sender uploads it, so the
  sender can broadcast on its next refresh without waiting for the receiver; the
  receiver still has to sync to accept the transfer.

To act as the sender yourself once A has BTC, run your own rgb-node-api on that
chain and drive an issuer wallet on it with `issuer.mjs`. rgb-node-api has no
authentication, so keep it on localhost. A configuration like this works; the
`btc_rpc_*` settings are required but rgb-node-api does not use them:

```toml
[api]
listen_address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 34100

[wallet]
data_dir = "./rgb-data-signet"
network = "Signet"
btc_rpc_address = "unused:0"
btc_rpc_user = "unused"
btc_rpc_password = "unused"
indexer_address = "https://esplora-api.utexo.com"
proxy_address = ["rpcs://rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc"]
```

Start it from an rgb-node-api checkout with `cargo run -- -c <that file>` (its
private git dependencies need read access to the UTEXO-Protocol repositories),
then:

```sh
export RGB_NODE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:34100 ISSUER_STATE="$W/issuer-signet.json"
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs address       # address tb1p…
# fund it from A (drive a sendbtc …), wait for a confirmation, then:
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs create-utxos  # created 4
# wait for a confirmation, then:
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs issue --ticker TST --name Test --supply 1000
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs send-rgb <asset> 500 '<A_INVOICE>'
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs refresh
```

The issuer's mnemonic stays in `$W/issuer-signet.json`; it is a throwaway test
wallet.

## Troubleshooting

**A spend fails with `policy.rejected`.** The trusted chain tip is from the
wrong chain or older than 300 seconds. On UTEXO's signet a public-signet tip is
hundreds of thousands of blocks behind, and the signer rejects the prepared
transaction.

**Invoice creation fails with `backend.protocol_mismatch`.** If the gateway
returned a valid invoice, the likely cause is its expiry: the Mac's clock and
the gateway's differ by more than 300 seconds. Check `date +%s` against a time
source.

**The first call fails with `backend.unavailable`.** It is retryable; run the
same command again. See the example [README](README.md).

**`drive.py` prints nothing and times out.** The app is not installed on the
simulator `--device` names, or that simulator is not booted. Check
`xcrun simctl list devices booted` and rerun `install.sh`.

**`rgbsend` or `blindinvoice` fails with `backend.rejected`
(`INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`) although the wallet has BTC.** Both need colored UTXOs.
An RGB send pays its fee and any witness output from them, and a blind invoice
receives onto a free one. Run `utxos`, wait for a confirmation (or mine one),
and retry.

**The issuer's `send-rgb` fails with `InsufficientAssignments` right after an
earlier send.** Its change is not spendable until that transfer settles. Run
`issuer.mjs refresh`, `issuer.mjs mine 1`, then `issuer.mjs refresh` again.

**An incoming RGB transfer stays `WaitingCounterparty`.** The receiver has not
accepted a consignment. Work through these:

1. Ask the proxy whether the sender posted one, using the recipient ID from the
   invoice (the `…:wvout:…` or `…:utxob:…` part):

   ```sh
   for m in consignment.get ack.get; do
       curl -s -X POST <proxy>/json-rpc -H 'content-type: application/json' \
           -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"1\",\"method\":\"$m\",\"params\":{\"recipient_id\":\"<id>\"}}"
       echo
   done
   ```

   UTEXO's proxy validates a consignment on upload and posts `ack: true` itself
   (`validated: true`). An ACK there therefore does **not** mean the receiver
   accepted it.
2. Neither the gateway nor rgb-node-api reports rgb-lib's per-transfer refresh
   result, but rgb-lib writes its own log for every wallet. On the local stack
   it is inside the rgb-node-api container, one directory per master
   fingerprint:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f "$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/compose.yaml exec rgb-node-api \
       sh -c 'tail -n 50 rgb-data/*/log'
   ```

   A `Skipping transport endpoint` line means the consignment fetch from the
   proxy returned nothing **or failed**. rgb-lib treats both the same way.
3. rgb-node-api's own log
   (`docker compose -f "$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/compose.yaml logs rgb-node-api`)
   records refreshes that failed outright.

To debug a deployed environment's receive path, run rgb-node-api locally with
that environment's network, indexer (`indexer_address`) and proxy
(`proxy_address`), and point `gateway.sh` at it. Then restore a wallet from the
same mnemonic into it with `drive.py --restore-from`, using a new wallet ID:

```sh
GATEWAY_PORT=8491 GATEWAY_DATA_DIR="$W/mirror" GATEWAY_BITCOIN_NETWORK=Signet \
RGB_NODE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<its port> ESPLORA_URL=https://esplora-api.utexo.com \
RGB_PROXY_URL=rpcs://rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc \
    example-app/scripts/gateway.sh > "$W/mirror.log" 2>&1 &
```

`RGB_PROXY_URL` must be exactly the `proxy_address` that rgb-node-api writes
into invoices, or sends between two of its wallets are rejected with
`TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT_NOT_ALLOWED`.

**Point rgb-node-api's `indexer_address` at an esplora REST URL, not an
electrs-esplora Electrum port.** Blockstream/mempool electrs answers Electrum
verbose-transaction requests with `verbose transactions are currently
unsupported`. rgb-lib's Electrum resolver needs those requests, for its
connect-time chain check and for validating received consignments. An
rgb-node-api with such an indexer either fails to bring wallets online (`InvalidIndexer:
resolver is for another chain-network pair`) or, with a build that skips that
check, syncs BTC but never accepts an RGB receive.

**Known issue (2026-10-15).** `minimal-gateway.utexo.com` never accepted
incoming consignments; its transfers stayed `WaitingCounterparty`. A local
gateway with the same code, rgb-lib (`0.3.0-beta.18`), network, indexer
(`https://esplora-api.utexo.com`) and proxy accepted its output of the same
transaction on the first sync, so the cause is in the deployed host's
environment, not in either SDK. The leading suspect is a container without
system CA certificates. Node and the esplora client bundle their own roots, but
rgb-lib's proxy client trusts only the system store, so BTC works while every
consignment fetch fails silently. Other suspects are an `HTTPS_PROXY` setting,
or the network path from the host to `rgb-proxy.utexo.com`. Check inside the
gateway container:

```sh
ls -la /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
env | grep -i -E '^(https?|no)_proxy|SSL_CERT'
grep -h 'Skipping transport\|Network error\|WARN\|ERRO' "$GATEWAY_WALLETS_DIR"/<userId>/*/log | tail
```
