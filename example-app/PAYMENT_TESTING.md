# Testing BTC and RGB payments with the example app

This runbook drives the [example app](README.md) on an iOS Simulator to test,
end to end:

- a BTC send between two wallets;
- an RGB receive from an issuer wallet, on a witness invoice;
- an RGB send between two wallets, signed on the device by the SDK.

It covers two environments. The **local regtest stack** is self-contained,
needs no funds or credentials, and lets you mine blocks and read gateway
internals, so use it for repeatable runs and for debugging. A **deployed signet
gateway** tests the real deployment, but needs an operator token and funds on
that chain.

The steps match the Kotlin SDK's runbook, so a run on one platform can be
compared line by line with the other.

## What you need

- macOS with Xcode 27.0 and a booted iPhone simulator, with the app installed:
  `xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16" && example-app/scripts/install.sh`.
- Python 3, for [`drive.py`](scripts/drive.py), and Node 20+, for
  [`issuer.mjs`](scripts/issuer.mjs).
- For the local stack only, a checkout of the lightsdk-gateway repository,
  built with `pnpm install && pnpm build`. It holds the gateway and its regtest
  stack (`regtest/`), which runs in Docker with the compose plugin. The stack builds rgb-node-api from source on its first
  start, and some of rgb-node-api's git dependencies are private, so your
  ssh-agent needs a key with read access to the UTEXO-Protocol repositories.
- A Mac clock within 300 seconds of real time. The simulator uses the Mac's
  clock, and invoice creation checks the gateway's expiry against it.

Run the commands below from the repository root. Keep tokens and mnemonics in a
working directory outside the repository:

```sh
W=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/utexo-payment-test; mkdir -p "$W"
export LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO=<path to the lightsdk-gateway checkout>
```

`gateway.sh` and `issuer.mjs` read `LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO` too. Without it they
look for the checkout next to this repository, under the repository's GitHub
name.

## The helpers

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) | Builds the app for the simulator and installs it on the booted one. |
| [`drive.py`](scripts/drive.py) | Relaunches the app with its fields in the environment, which connects and runs the named actions in order, then prints what the app logged. |
| [`issuer.mjs`](scripts/issuer.mjs) | Drives an RGB issuer and sender — a wallet on rgb-node-api whose keys the script holds and signs with (`setup`, `send-rgb`, `refresh`, and `address`, `create-utxos`, `issue` on other chains), and regtest (`mine`, `fund`). |
| [`gateway.sh`](scripts/gateway.sh) | Starts a local lightsdk-gateway against the regtest stack. |
| [`tip.mjs`](scripts/tip.mjs) | Serves the regtest chain tip as `GET /blocks/tip/height`, read from the stack's electrs, for the app's trusted chain context. |

Each `drive.py` run is one app session. `--wallet` names the wallet, and the app
keeps one Keychain seed per wallet ID and network. A wallet ID is bound to the
first gateway user it registers with, and reusing it with another user fails
with `wallet.invalid_state`. So use fresh wallet IDs whenever you create new
gateway users, as the `RUN` variable below does.

## Local regtest run

### 1. Start the regtest stack

```sh
"$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/regtest.sh start
```

This starts bitcoind, electrs (`tcp://127.0.0.1:50001`), the RGB proxy and
rgb-node-api (`:34000`) on a fresh chain, deleting any earlier regtest state. The
first start builds the rgb-node-api image, which takes several minutes.

Only electrs and rgb-node-api are published on the host. If `50001` or `34000` is
taken, for example by another regtest stack, start with `REGTEST_ELECTRUM_PORT` /
`REGTEST_RGB_NODE_API_PORT` set, and pass the same ports to the gateway and
`tip.mjs` (`ELECTRUM_URL`, `RGB_NODE_API_URL`). rgb-node-api reaches bitcoind,
electrs and the proxy over the compose network, which is why invoices name the
proxy `rpc://proxy:3000/json-rpc`.

### 2. Set up the issuer and issue an asset

```sh
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs setup
# issuer 1a2b3c4d
# asset rgb:…         <- keep this as ASSET
```

`setup` creates a throwaway issuer wallet on rgb-node-api (its mnemonic is kept in
`$TMPDIR/utexo-payment-test/issuer.json`), funds it with 1 BTC, creates colored
UTXOs and issues 1,000 units of an NIA asset (`--ticker`, `--name` and
`--supply` change it). Put the printed asset ID in `ASSET`.

### 3. Start the gateway and the tip server, and create two users

```sh
example-app/scripts/gateway.sh > "$W/gateway.log" 2>&1 &
example-app/scripts/tip.mjs > "$W/tip.log" 2>&1 &
until curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8490/v1/health > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done
for u in a b; do
    curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8490/v1/users \
        -H "x-operator-token: $(cat "$W/gateway/operator_token")" > "$W/user-$u.json"
done
RUN=$(date +%s)
drive() {
    who=$1; shift
    example-app/scripts/drive.py --gateway http://127.0.0.1:8490 --network regtest \
        --tip-url http://127.0.0.1:3003/blocks/tip/height \
        --token-file "$W/user-$who.json" --wallet "loc-$RUN-$who" \
        --mnemonic-out "$W/mnemonic-$who" "$@"
}
```

The simulator shares the Mac's network, so the app reaches the gateway and
`tip.mjs` on `127.0.0.1` directly. The trusted chain tip comes from the stack's
electrs through `tip.mjs`, not from the gateway.

### 4. BTC payment

```sh
drive a address                    # address: bcrt1p…   <- A
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs fund <A> 0.01
drive a sync,balance               # vanilla settled=1000000
drive b address                    # address: bcrt1p…   <- B
drive a sendbtc recipient=<B> amount=50000
                                   # sent: txid …
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b sync,balance               # vanilla settled=50000
```

The device validates the gateway-prepared transaction against the request and
the trusted tip, signs it, and the gateway broadcasts it.

### 5. RGB receive: issuer → A, witness invoice

```sh
drive a witnessinvoice             # invoice: rgb:~/~/~/bcrt:wvout:…   <- A_INVOICE
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs send-rgb "$ASSET" 500 '<A_INVOICE>'
drive a sync,transfers,assets      # ReceiveWitness WaitingBroadcast; future=500
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs refresh   # the issuer sees A's ACK and broadcasts
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive a sync,assets                # settled=500 spendable=500
```

Quote invoices: they contain `?` and `&`. For a witness invoice, `send-rgb` adds
1,000 sats for the output it creates for the receiver.

Every RGB payment takes three turns, because the sender (the issuer and the SDK
alike, with `donation: false`) broadcasts only after the receiver ACKs:

1. The receiver syncs: it fetches the consignment, validates it and ACKs. Its
   transfer then reads `WaitingBroadcast`.
2. The sender refreshes: it sees the ACK and broadcasts.
3. After a block, the receiver's next sync settles the transfer.

The txid that `send-rgb` and `rgbsend` print is not on chain until step 2.

rgb-node-api also refreshes every wallet it has loaded every 10 seconds on its
own, so steps 2 and 3 can happen between your commands. The app's invoices ask
for zero confirmations, so a transfer may already read `Settled` where the
comments show `WaitingBroadcast`, and a sender may broadcast before you sync it.

### 6. RGB send: A → B, signed by the SDK

```sh
drive a utxos                      # created 4 colored UTXO(s) in …
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b witnessinvoice             # invoice: rgb:~/~/~/bcrt:wvout:…   <- B_INVOICE
drive a rgbsend recipient='<B_INVOICE>' amount=100 assetId="$ASSET"
                                   # sent: txid … batchTransferIdx=…
drive b sync,transfers             # ReceiveWitness WaitingBroadcast, amounts=100
drive a sync,transfers             # Send WaitingConfirmations, amounts=400 (A's change),
                                   # listed after step 5's settled receive
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs mine 1
drive b sync,assets                # settled=100
drive a sync,assets                # settled=400
```

An RGB send is funded from colored UTXOs only: its fee, B's 1,000-sat witness
output and A's change all come from them, not from A's vanilla balance. The
1,000-sat output A received the asset on is not enough, hence `utxos` first. It
tops A up to five UTXOs with free allocation slots, and the output A received
on still has free slots, so it creates four. Sync B before A: B's sync ACKs,
and A's sync is what broadcasts.

### 7. Stop

```sh
kill %1 %2                         # the gateway and tip.mjs started above
"$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/regtest.sh stop
```

## Deployed signet run

The app's defaults target UTEXO's stage gateway,
`https://stage.gateway.lightsdk.utexo.com`, which runs on **Bitcoin's public
signet** (`Network.signet`, invoices tagged `sb`). The trusted tip comes from
`https://mempool.space/signet/api/blocks/tip/height`; look transactions up at
`https://mempool.space/signet/tx/<txid>`.

Create the users with the deployment's operator token. Then use the same `drive`
helper without the local flags:

```sh
for u in a b; do
    curl -s -X POST https://stage.gateway.lightsdk.utexo.com/v1/users \
        -H "x-operator-token: $GATEWAY_OPERATOR_TOKEN" > "$W/signet-user-$u.json"
done
RUN=$(date +%s)
drive() {
    who=$1; shift
    example-app/scripts/drive.py --token-file "$W/signet-user-$who.json" \
        --wallet "gw-$RUN-$who" --mnemonic-out "$W/signet-mnemonic-$who" "$@"
}
```

Steps 4–6 work the same way, except:

- nothing mines blocks, so wait for a confirmation (about 10 minutes) where the
  local run mines one;
- fund A from a public signet faucet (BTC to `drive a address`). 20,000 sats
  covers steps 4–6 with small amounts;
- the stage proxy, `rpcs://stage.rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc`, speaks RGB
  proxy protocol 1.0: invoices carry the recipient's Ed25519 key as `pk=…`, and
  a sender encrypts the consignment to it. `rgbsend` and `issuer.mjs send-rgb`
  pass the invoice's `pk`, `expiry` and `enc` on. The receiver ACKs with that
  key, so it must sync before the sender's refresh can broadcast;
- a proxy redeploy can drop its invoice reservations. Sending to an invoice made
  before one fails with `InvoiceNotReserved`; ask the receiver for a new invoice.

To act as the sender yourself once A has BTC, run your own rgb-node-api (main)
on that chain and drive an issuer wallet on it with `issuer.mjs`. RLN cannot be
the issuer: its rgb-lib speaks proxy protocol 0.2. rgb-node-api has no
authentication, so keep it on localhost. A configuration like this works; the
`btc_rpc_*` settings are required but rgb-node-api does not use them:

```toml
[api]
listen_address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 34100

[wallet]
data_dir = "./rgb-data-signet"
network = "Signet"
btc_rpc_address = "unused:0"
btc_rpc_user = "unused"
btc_rpc_password = "unused"
indexer_address = "https://mempool.space/signet/api"
proxy_address = ["rpcs://stage.rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc"]
```

Start it from an rgb-node-api checkout with `cargo run -- -c <that file>` (its
private git dependencies need read access to the UTEXO-Protocol repositories),
then:

```sh
export RGB_NODE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:34100 ISSUER_STATE="$W/issuer-signet.json"
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs address       # address tb1p…
# fund it from A (drive a sendbtc …), wait for a confirmation, then:
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs create-utxos --num 4 --size 1500  # created 4
# wait for a confirmation, then:
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs issue --ticker TST --name Test --supply 1000
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs send-rgb <asset> 500 '<A_INVOICE>'
example-app/scripts/issuer.mjs refresh
```

The issuer's mnemonic stays in `$W/issuer-signet.json`; it is a throwaway test
wallet.

## Troubleshooting

**A spend fails with `policy.rejected`.** The trusted chain tip is from a chain
other than the gateway's, or older than 300 seconds. A tip from another chain is
far off the gateway's height, and the signer rejects the prepared transaction.
For the stage gateway use the public-signet tip above.

**`witnessinvoice`, `blindinvoice` or `rgbsend` fails with
`validation.invalid_argument` about the invoice.** The SDK build predates proxy
protocol 1.0 invoices, whose `pk=` parameter its native invoice decoder rejects.
Use an SDK whose signer accepts `pk` and `enc`.

**`rgbsend` fails with `backend.rejected` (`INVALID_RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY`).**
The gateway's rgb-node-api needs the invoice's recipient key and did not get a
valid one: the gateway predates `recipientPublicKey`, or the invoice is not a
protocol 1.0 invoice from that proxy.

**Invoice creation fails with `backend.protocol_mismatch`.** If the gateway
returned a valid invoice, the likely cause is its expiry: the Mac's clock and
the gateway's differ by more than 300 seconds. Check `date +%s` against a time
source.

**The first call fails with `backend.unavailable`.** It is retryable; run the
same command again. See the example [README](README.md).

**`drive.py` prints nothing and times out.** The app is not installed on the
simulator `--device` names, or that simulator is not booted. Check
`xcrun simctl list devices booted` and rerun `install.sh`.

**`rgbsend` or `blindinvoice` fails with `backend.rejected`
(`INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`) although the wallet has BTC.** Both need colored UTXOs.
An RGB send pays its fee and any witness output from them, and a blind invoice
receives onto a free one. Run `utxos`, wait for a confirmation (or mine one),
and retry.

**The issuer's `send-rgb` fails with `InsufficientAssignments` right after an
earlier send.** Its change is not spendable until that transfer settles. Run
`issuer.mjs refresh`, `issuer.mjs mine 1`, then `issuer.mjs refresh` again.

**An incoming RGB transfer stays `WaitingCounterparty`.** The receiver has not
accepted a consignment. Work through these:

1. Ask the proxy whether the sender posted one, using the recipient ID from the
   invoice (the `…:wvout:…` or `…:utxob:…` part):

   ```sh
   for m in consignment.get ack.get; do
       curl -s -X POST <proxy>/json-rpc -H 'content-type: application/json' \
           -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"1\",\"method\":\"$m\",\"params\":{\"recipient_id\":\"<id>\"}}"
       echo
   done
   ```

   These calls are for a protocol 0.2 proxy. UTEXO's 0.2 proxy validates a
   consignment on upload and posts `ack: true` itself (`validated: true`), so an
   ACK there does **not** mean the receiver accepted it. A protocol 1.0 proxy,
   such as stage's, keys these calls by transfer ID instead, and stores only ACKs
   signed with the invoice's `pk`: there an ACK does mean the receiver accepted.
2. Neither the gateway nor rgb-node-api reports rgb-lib's per-transfer refresh
   result, but rgb-lib writes its own log for every wallet. On the local stack
   it is inside the rgb-node-api container, one directory per master
   fingerprint:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f "$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/compose.yaml exec rgb-node-api \
       sh -c 'tail -n 50 rgb-data/*/log'
   ```

   A `Skipping transport endpoint` line means the consignment fetch from the
   proxy returned nothing **or failed**. rgb-lib treats both the same way.
3. rgb-node-api's own log
   (`docker compose -f "$LIGHTSDK_GATEWAY_REPO"/regtest/compose.yaml logs rgb-node-api`)
   records refreshes that failed outright.

To debug a deployed environment's receive path, run rgb-node-api locally with
that environment's network, indexer (`indexer_address`) and proxy
(`proxy_address`), and point `gateway.sh` at it. Then restore a wallet from the
same mnemonic into it with `drive.py --restore-from`, using a new wallet ID:

```sh
GATEWAY_PORT=8491 GATEWAY_DATA_DIR="$W/mirror" GATEWAY_BITCOIN_NETWORK=Signet \
RGB_NODE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<its port> \
RGB_PROXY_URL=rpcs://stage.rgb-proxy.utexo.com/json-rpc \
    example-app/scripts/gateway.sh > "$W/mirror.log" 2>&1 &
```

`RGB_PROXY_URL` must be exactly the `proxy_address` that rgb-node-api writes
into invoices, or sends between two of its wallets are rejected with
`TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT_NOT_ALLOWED`.

**Point rgb-node-api's `indexer_address` at a full Electrum server, such as the
regtest stack's electrs, or at a REST indexer API such as mempool.space's, not
at Blockstream's electrs fork.** That fork, which mempool.space also runs,
answers Electrum verbose-transaction requests with `verbose transactions are
currently unsupported`. rgb-lib's Electrum resolver needs those requests, for
its connect-time chain check and for validating received consignments. An
rgb-node-api with such an indexer either fails to bring wallets online
(`InvalidIndexer: resolver is for another chain-network pair`) or, with a build
that skips that check, syncs BTC but never accepts an RGB receive. The gateway's
`ELECTRUM_URL` has no such requirement: it asks only for fee estimates.
